## Introduction

The UCSC Genome Browser Sequence and Annotations project aims to facilitate genomic research and analysis by providing a rich collection of genome sequences and annotations for various organisms. The dataset includes assembled genome sequences, reference gene annotations, regulatory elements, variation data, and more.

## Data Availability

The dataset is available for multiple species, including but not limited to:

- Human (Homo sapiens)
- Mouse (Mus musculus)
- Fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster)
- Zebrafish (Danio rerio)
- Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana)

For a complete list of supported species, please refer to the official UCSC Genome Browser website.
